## Features
- Benchmarking tasks including image classification, object detection, language translation, and more.
- Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Visualization of performance metrics using charts and graphs.
- Flexibility in selecting the computational device and data type.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the `workspace` directory:
   ```bash
   cd torch_device_dtype_benchmark/workspace
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the benchmarking suite using the provided shell script:

```bash
./run.sh --device <device> --dtype <dtype>
```
Replace `<device>` with the desired computational device (e.g., "CPU", "CUDA 0") and `<dtype>` with the desired data type (e.g., "float16", "float32").
