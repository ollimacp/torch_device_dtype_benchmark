### Project Description

#### Current State:
The current project is a Python-based benchmarking suite for neural networks. The core functionality includes:
- Selection of computational devices (e.g., CPU, CUDA 0, 1, 2).
- Choice among various data types supported by PyTorch (e.g., float16, float32).
- A class structure (`BenchmarkTasks`) that enables easy addition and selection of different benchmarking tasks.
- An implemented example task for binary classification.
- A scoreboard to keep track of results and performance metrics.
- Basic data visualization to graphically represent the performance of different tasks.


### Classes:
1. **BenchmarkTasks**: A class that includes different benchmarking tasks and handling of results.

### Functions:
Within the `BenchmarkTasks` class:
- `__init__(self, device, dtype)`: Constructor to initialize device and data type.
- `binary_classification(self)`: A method to run the binary classification task.
- `display_scoreboard(self)`: A method to print the scoreboard.
- `visualize_scoreboard(self)`: A method to visualize the scoreboard.

### Variables:
Within the `BenchmarkTasks` class:
- `device`: Specifies the computational device (e.g., CPU, CUDA 0, 1, 2).
- `dtype`: Specifies the data type (e.g., float16, float32).
- `scoreboard`: A list to store the results of different benchmarking tasks.

### Outside the Class:
- Command-line arguments:
  - `device`: Allows the user to specify the computational device.
  - `dtype`: Allows the user to select the data type.

### State:
- The state of the benchmarking tasks is maintained through instances of the `BenchmarkTasks` class, including the chosen device, data type, and the scoreboard to record results.

The code structure is designed to be modular and extendable, allowing for the addition of more benchmarking tasks and features.


#### Next Steps:

1. **Extend Benchmarking Tasks**: More complex and diversified benchmarking tasks should be added to the existing class to provide a comprehensive testing suite.

2. **Enhance Data Visualization**: The current data visualization can be extended to represent more metrics and provide more in-depth insights into the performance.

3. **Input/Output Handling**: Refine the user interface and enhance the reporting features to offer a user-friendly command-line experience.

4. **Testing and Validation**: Rigorous testing must be conducted to ensure the code's robustness and validity according to various scenarios and edge cases.

5. **Documentation**: Extensive documentation should be written, covering all functions, classes, and usage guidelines. This will ensure that the code is well understood and easily maintainable.

6. **Compliance with Standards**: If alignment with NASA standards is required, further efforts should be focused on code quality, documentation, testing, and verification to meet these stringent criteria.

7. **GitHub Deployment**: The project needs to be structured with a proper directory layout, ReadMe files, contributing guidelines, and license information for GitHub deployment.

### Suggested Directory Layout:

- **/src**: Source code folder containing the main script and any additional modules.
- **/tests**: Folder containing unit tests and other testing scripts.
- **/data**: If applicable, a folder for storing data used in the benchmarks.
- **/docs**: Documentation folder containing user guides, API references, and other documentation.
- **/visualizations**: Folder to store any generated visualizations or related scripts.
- **README.md**: A comprehensive ReadMe file describing the project, usage, and contributing guidelines.
- **LICENSE**: The license file for the project.
- **.gitignore**: A file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.

### Conclusion:
The project is well underway with core functionality in place, and with additional development, testing, and documentation, it can be molded into a fully deployable, robust benchmarking tool that complies with industry standards.
